This is an implementation of the paper of the online convex optimization algorithm with adversarial constraints described in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18955. In particular, we
use the algorithm to solve the credit card fraud detection problem using a simple two-layer neural network architecture using a publicly available dataset.
